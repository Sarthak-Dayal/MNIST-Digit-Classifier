# MNIST Digit Classifier
A simple handwritten digit classifier built using the MNIST database, keras and numpy inspired by Hack Club's Handwriting Recognition workshop. 
This project uses a neural network with 3 dense layers, including the input and output. This particular case uses Mean Squared Error as the error metric and has a accuracy of about 97.8%
